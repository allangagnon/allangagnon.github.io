<h1>NetTryx LLC.</h1>
<p>NetTryx is an established web based LLC located now in Omaha, Nebraska. We offer Internet and Web-related services to small businesses. The services we offer include website development and design, hosting, maintenance, marketing, and analysis. Given our experience and expertise in both commercial Web development and business-to-business sales, we believe we can offer a unique and superior service to small business owners, in comparison to what is currently available.</p>

<p>The demand and growth rate for Web development and marketing services in the small business market is at an all time high and shows no sign of slowing anytime soon. Even more astonishing is the fact that very few Web development companies have taken advantage of the opportunity, as there are no dominating participants in this huge market.</p>

<p>We believe the reason for this virtually untapped market is due to expensive project costs, the highest profit margins in Web development today are in servicing large and medium-sized corporations. We have developed a system that dramatically reduces steep project costs and henceforth will allow us to offer the same high-end Web development services as larger companies receive at a much lower cost to the client.</p>
